## Requirements

- **Task Management:**
  - Use a GitHub Projects task manager to track your tickets.
  
- **Git Branching Strategy:**
  - The `main` branch is your final branch.
  - You may use a `dev` branch for continuous merging.

- **Design Translation:**
  - Convert the Figma design to Next.js without modifying any designs.
  - The accuracy of your conversion will directly impact your score.
  
- **Responsiveness:**
  - Ensure the website is fluid and responsive.
  - It must work seamlessly on both mobile phones and desktop web browsers.

- **Styling:**
  - Maintain consistent margins and styles throughout the project.
  - Use Tailwind CSS as your primary styling tool, with additional CSS files allowed for minor adjustments.

- **Reusability:**
  - Reuse design patterns wherever possible (e.g., buttons and components should have a consistent style across the app).

- **Communication:**
  - If you have any questions or doubts about the design, ask for clarification instead of making assumptions.
